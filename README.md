<h1>Network Switch</h1>
<p>Modern Android app for 4G/5G network mode switching</p>
</div>

---

A modern Android application that enables users to toggle between 4G and 5G network modes with dual control methods: Root access for rooted devices and Shizuku for non-rooted devices. Built using Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3.

## Purpose

Network Switch allows Android users to manually control their device's network preference between pure 4G (LTE-only) and 5G (NR-only) modes. This is useful for:

- Quick network switching through Quick Settings tile
- Optimizing battery life by forcing 4G mode
- Maximizing speed by forcing 5G mode where available
- Managing data usage and connectivity preferences

The app provides two methods of operation:
- **Root Method**: Direct system access for rooted devices
- **Shizuku Method**: System access through Shizuku service for non-rooted devices

## Features

- Pure network mode switching (LTE-only for 4G, NR-only for 5G)
- Quick Settings tile for instant access
- Dual control methods (Root and Shizuku)
- Modern Material Design 3 interface
- Clean architecture implementation
- Privacy-focused (no internet permissions)
- Intelligent device compatibility detection
- Automatic fallback for unsupported devices

## Requirements

### Root Method
- Rooted Android device (Android 10+)
- Root permissions granted to the app

### Shizuku Method
- Non-rooted Android device (Android 10+)
